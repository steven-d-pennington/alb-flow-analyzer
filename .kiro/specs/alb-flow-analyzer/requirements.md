# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a tool for analyzing AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) Flow logs to understand usage patterns and generate insights that can be used to build effective JMeter performance tests. The tool will parse ALB flow logs, extract meaningful metrics, and provide actionable data for load testing scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to parse ALB flow logs, so that I can extract request patterns and traffic data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ALB flow log files are provided THEN the system SHALL parse the standard ALB flow log format
2. WHEN parsing flow logs THEN the system SHALL extract timestamp, client IP, target IP, request processing time, target processing time, response processing time, ELB status code, target status code, received bytes, sent bytes, request verb, request URL, request protocol, user agent, SSL cipher, SSL protocol, target group ARN, trace ID, domain name, chosen cert ARN, matched rule priority, request creation time, actions executed, redirect URL, error reason, target port list, target status code list, classification, and classification reason
3. IF a log entry is malformed THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing remaining entries
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successfully parsed vs failed entries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to analyze request patterns from ALB logs, so that I can understand traffic distribution and identify peak usage periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing parsed logs THEN the system SHALL calculate requests per minute/hour/day metrics
2. WHEN analyzing request patterns THEN the system SHALL identify the most frequently accessed endpoints
3. WHEN analyzing traffic THEN the system SHALL determine peak traffic periods with timestamps
4. WHEN analyzing response times THEN the system SHALL calculate percentiles (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th) for request processing times
5. WHEN analyzing status codes THEN the system SHALL provide distribution of HTTP status codes
6. WHEN analyzing user agents THEN the system SHALL categorize and count different client types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to generate AWS Distributed Load Testing scenarios based on ALB log analysis, so that I can create realistic load tests that mirror production traffic patterns using AWS's managed solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating test scenarios THEN the system SHALL create test configurations compatible with AWS Distributed Load Testing solution
2. WHEN creating test scenarios THEN the system SHALL include the most frequently accessed endpoints with appropriate weights
3. WHEN generating load patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest ramp-up profiles based on observed traffic patterns
4. WHEN creating scenarios THEN the system SHALL include realistic think times based on request intervals
5. WHEN generating test data THEN the system SHALL provide sample request parameters extracted from logs
6. WHEN exporting scenarios THEN the system SHALL generate test configuration files compatible with AWS Distributed Load Testing CloudFormation templates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to filter and segment ALB log data, so that I can focus analysis on specific time periods, endpoints, or client types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL support date/time range filtering
2. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by specific endpoints or URL patterns
3. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by HTTP status code ranges
4. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by client IP ranges or specific IPs
5. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by user agent patterns
6. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state and allow combining multiple filters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to export analysis results in multiple formats, so that I can share insights with team members and integrate with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL support CSV format for raw data export
2. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL support JSON format for programmatic consumption
3. WHEN exporting visualizations THEN the system SHALL generate charts showing traffic patterns over time
4. WHEN exporting summaries THEN the system SHALL create human-readable reports with key metrics and insights
5. WHEN exporting test plans THEN the system SHALL generate valid AWS Distributed Load Testing configuration files
6. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest corrective actions
